# IntelliPen Extension Icons

This directory contains the extension icons in the required sizes for Chrome extensions:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows computers often use this size)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Icon Design Guidelines

The IntelliPen icons should:
- Use the pen/writing theme with the üñãÔ∏è emoji as inspiration
- Maintain consistent branding with the purple gradient theme (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Be clearly visible at all sizes
- Follow Chrome extension icon best practices

## Temporary Placeholder

For development purposes, you can create simple placeholder icons or use the emoji üñãÔ∏è as a temporary solution until proper icons are designed.

To create placeholder icons quickly:
1. Create a 128x128 PNG with the IntelliPen logo/text
2. Resize to create the smaller versions
3. Ensure good contrast and readability at small sizes

## Production Icons

For production, consider:
- Professional icon design
- SVG source files for scalability
- Multiple color variants if needed
- Accessibility considerations (contrast, clarity)
