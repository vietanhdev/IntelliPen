# IntelliPen Toggle Functionality Fix

## Problem
The popup was showing an error when trying to toggle writing intelligence:
```
Failed to toggle writing intelligence: Error: Failed to toggle writing intelligence
```

## Root Cause
The background script was missing message handlers for the `TOGGLE_WRITING_INTELLIGENCE` and `TOGGLE_MEETING_INTELLIGENCE` messages that the popup was trying to send.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Background Script Updates (`background.js`)
- Added message handlers for `TOGGLE_WRITING_INTELLIGENCE` and `TOGGLE_MEETING_INTELLIGENCE`
- Added methods to get/set toggle states from Chrome storage
- Added broadcasting functionality to notify content scripts of toggle changes
- Added session cleanup when features are disabled

### 2. Content Script Updates (`content-scripts/universal-integration.js`)
- Added message handlers for `WRITING_INTELLIGENCE_TOGGLED` and `MEETING_INTELLIGENCE_TOGGLED`
- Added methods to activate/deactivate elements based on toggle state
- Added visual indicators for active elements

### 3. Popup Updates (`popup/index.js`)
- Updated to load and display current toggle states from extension status
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 4. CSS Updates (`styles/overlay.css`)
- Added styling for active elements (`.intellipen-active` class)
- Added visual indicators with blue border and subtle shadow

## Key Features Added

### Toggle State Persistence
- Settings are stored in Chrome's local storage
- States persist across browser sessions
- Default to enabled for both features

### Visual Feedback
- Active text fields show blue border when writing intelligence is enabled
- Elements are properly activated/deactivated based on toggle state
- Smooth transitions for better user experience

### Message Broadcasting
- Background script broadcasts toggle changes to all content scripts
- Content scripts respond immediately to toggle changes
- Proper cleanup of sessions when features are disabled

### Error Handling
- Proper error messages in popup
- Graceful fallbacks if storage operations fail
- Console logging for debugging

## Testing
Created `test-toggle-functionality.html` to verify:
- Toggle switches work without errors
- Visual indicators appear/disappear correctly
- Console messages show proper toggle events
- Text fields are properly activated/deactivated

## Files Modified
1. `background.js` - Added toggle message handlers and state management
2. `content-scripts/universal-integration.js` - Added toggle response handlers
3. `popup/index.js` - Updated to show current toggle states
4. `styles/overlay.css` - Added active element styling

## Usage
1. Click the IntelliPen extension icon to open popup
2. Use the toggle switches to enable/disable features
3. Observe visual changes in text fields on web pages
4. Check browser console for toggle event messages

The toggle functionality now works correctly and provides proper visual feedback to users.
