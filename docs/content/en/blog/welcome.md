  Introducing IntelliPen - Your intelligent writing companion powered by Chrome's built-in AI
---

We're excited to introduce IntelliPen, a Chrome extension that brings professional writing assistance, real-time translation, and meeting intelligence directly to your browser—all processed locally on your device with zero data sharing.

## Why IntelliPen?

In today's digital world, we write more than ever—emails, documents, social media posts, meeting notes. But most AI writing tools require sending your data to external servers, raising privacy concerns and requiring expensive subscriptions.

IntelliPen is different. It leverages Chrome's built-in AI APIs (Gemini Nano) to process everything locally on your device. Your data never leaves your computer.

## Key Features

### IntelliPen Editor
- Grammar checking with real-time corrections
- Writing improvement suggestions
- Tone adjustment (formal, casual, professional)
- Content generation from prompts
- Document management with auto-save

### Translator
- Multi-language translation (25+ languages)
- Auto-detection of source language
- Text-to-speech for pronunciation
- Context menu integration for quick translate
- Works completely offline

### Meeting Dashboard
- Audio recording and live transcription
- AI-powered meeting analysis
- Action item extraction
- Key decision identification
- Follow-up email generation

## Privacy First

IntelliPen is built with privacy as a core principle:

- **Local Processing**: All AI operations happen on your device
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect, store, or transmit your data
- **Encrypted Storage**: Local data is encrypted with industry-standard encryption
- **Open Source**: Code is publicly available for audit
