## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Setup

```javascript
import WritingIntelligenceEngine from './WritingIntelligenceEngine.js';
import SuggestionOverlay from './ui/SuggestionOverlay.js';
import KeyboardNavigationManager from './ui/KeyboardNavigationManager.js';

// Initialize the engine
const engine = new WritingIntelligenceEngine();
await engine.initialize();

// Initialize UI components
const overlay = new SuggestionOverlay();
const keyboardManager = new KeyboardNavigationManager(overlay);
overlay.initialize();

// Analyze text
const analysis = await engine.analyzeText('this is a test sentence', {
  platform: 'gmail.com'
});

// Create visual overlay
if (analysis.suggestions.length > 0) {
  overlay.createOverlay(textElement, analysis.suggestions);
}
```

### Advanced Usage with Learning

```javascript
import SuggestionApplicationManager from './SuggestionApplicationManager.js';
import UserPreferenceLearning from './UserPreferenceLearning.js';

// Initialize learning system
const applicationManager = new SuggestionApplicationManager(engine);
const learning = new UserPreferenceLearning();

// Apply suggestions with learning
const result = await applicationManager.applySuggestion(suggestion, textElement);

// Get personalized suggestions
const personalizedSuggestions = learning.filterSuggestions(
  analysis.suggestions, 
  textElement,
  { threshold: 0.3, maxSuggestions: 5 }
);
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Suggestion Overlay
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded highlights for different suggestion types
- **Tooltips**: Detailed explanations with apply/ignore actions
- **Control Panel**: Statistics and branding display
- **Animations**: Smooth appearance and application animations

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab Navigation**: Navigate between suggestions
- **Quick Actions**: A (apply), I (ignore), N (next error), P (previous error)
- **Help System**: H key shows keyboard shortcuts
- **Screen Reader**: Full accessibility support

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Core Tests
```bash
node src/writing-intelligence/test-writing-intelligence.js
```

### Run Application Tests
```bash
node src/writing-intelligence/test-suggestion-application-simple.js
```

### Run UI Tests (Browser)
Open `src/writing-intelligence/ui/test-ui-runner.html` in a browser

## 📊 Performance
