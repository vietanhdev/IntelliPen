Submission Modifications.

Draft Submissions: Prior to the end of the Contest Period, you may save draft versions of your submission on Devpost to your portfolio before submitting the submission materials to the Contest for evaluation. Once the Contest Period has ended, you may not make any changes or alterations to your submission, but you may continue to update the application in your Devpost portfolio.

Modifications After the Contest Period. The Sponsor and Administrator may permit you to modify part of your submission after the Contest Period for the purpose of adding, removing or replacing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate.

At any time, and at its sole discretion, the Poster will have the ability to re-assign a submitted Submission from one Category to another or to disqualify a submission for not sufficiently fitting the Application or Submission Requirement.

All Entries must be received by 11:45:00 P.M., Pacific Time (PT) on  October 31, 2025.  Entries are void if they are in whole or part illegible, incomplete, damaged, altered, counterfeit, obtained through fraud, or late. All Entries will be deemed made by the authorized account holder of the email address submitted at the time of entry, and the potential winner may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder for that email address. The "authorized account holder" is the natural person assigned to an email address by an Internet service provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning email address for the domain.

During the Contest Period, the Sponsor, its agents and/or the Judges (defined below) will be evaluating each Entry to ensure that it meets the Requirements.  The Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any entrant who submits an Entry that does not meet the Requirements. 

7\. JUDGING: Each entry will be judged by a panel of experts who are employees of Sponsor ("Judges").  On or about November 3, 2025, each Entry will be evaluated by the Judges based on the following criteria:

Stage One: The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the Entry meets a baseline level of viability, in that the Entry reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Contest.

Stage Two: All Entries that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria:

1.  Functionality 
    -   How scalable is the application? How well are the APIs used within the project? Can it be used in other regions, or can it be used by more than one type of audience?
2.  Purpose
    -   Are you solving an existing problem in a compelling manner? Is it an application that would encourage a user to use it more than once for its benefits?
3.  Content
    -   How creative is the application? What's the visual quality like?
4.  User Experience
    -   How well executed is the application? Is it easy to use and understand? 
5.  Technical Execution
    -   How well are you showcasing 1 or more of the APIs powered by AI models built into Google Chrome?

Judges will evaluate and attribute a score to each Entry made up of scores based upon the above-listed criteria. The Entries that receive the highest overall scores will be selected as the potential winner(s). In the event of a tie, the Entry that received the higher score from the Judges in the category of "Purpose" will be selected as one of the potential winner(s).  In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Entry that received the next highest total score will be chosen as the potential winner.

Most Valuable Feedback Submission:

Eligible Feedback Submissions will be evaluated based on the completeness, viability, and potential impact of the feedback and written description.

On or about December 5, 2025, the potential winner(s) will be selected and notified by telephone and/or email, at Sponsor's discretion. If a potential winner does not respond to the notification attempt within [3] days from the first notification attempt, then such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the judging criteria described herein. With respect to notification by telephone, such notification will be deemed given when the potential winner engages in a live conversation with Sponsor or when a message is left on the potential winner's voicemail service or answering machine by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Except where prohibited by law, each potential winner may be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release and provide any additional information that may be required by Sponsor.  If required, potential winners must return all such required documents within [5] days following attempted notification or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected based on the judging criteria described herein. All notification requirements, as well as other requirements within these Rules, will be strictly enforced.

In the event that no Entries are received, no prize will be awarded.  Determinations of judges are final and binding.
